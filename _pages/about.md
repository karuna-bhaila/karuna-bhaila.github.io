<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a CS Ph.D. student in the [SAIL](https://sail.uark.edu/) lab advised by [Dr. Xintao Wu](http://www.csce.uark.edu/~xintaowu/) at the University of Arkansas.

My research focuses on graph machine learning with an emphasis on trustworthy learning, especially privacy and fairness. 
I am also broadly interested in trustworthy foundation models, graph foundation models and applications of LLMs on graph data.
Currently, I am also working on applications of graph machine learning in physical systems such as critical infrastructure networks.
